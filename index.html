                            <h2>The Fellowship of the Ring</h2>
                                <p class="story">Sauron creates ring of power thousands of years ago and loses it in battle. Man tricked by bad ring's power and refuses to destroy it, so Sauron lives on with his 
                                    life force tied to the ring.
                                    Smeagol finds ring, loses it to Bilbo Baggins who keeps it in secret in the Shire. Bilbo goes to live with elves and gives ring to nephew, Frodo
                                    after Gandalf says he got to. Smeagol while being tortured tells Sauron's minions where ring could be, so Frodo and friends run the heck away. Gandalf leaves Frodo
                                    and his homie Sam to seek counsel from his wizard elder, Sarumon, who betrays him wanting the ring to give to Sauron. Meanwhile Frodo and company meet a strange man
                                    who helps them escape Sauron's main minions who chase them for a while. They find Frodo's company while they're cooking and stab him, which is pretty messed up.
                                    Eventually they meet Bilbo at Rivendell (Elf world for the layman) and decide the ring gotta go. So a group of 8 others, including 3 useless hobbits
                                    aid Frodo in getting the ring to Mount Doom in Mordor where it can be disposed of. They go through the mines of Moria (Dwarf world for the layman) and 
                                    Gandalf falls off a bridge while lecturing the Balrog of Morgoth, a demon of the ancient world. The crew cries they homies' tears and continue on until they
                                    reach another Elf world (even I don't remember this one's name), and they chill for the night. They get up and are kicked out to continue, and are quickly
                                    ambushed by Sarumon's orks. One of the party is killed, but nobody really liked him anyway, and Frodo decides to go off on his own because the guy that was killed tried 
                                    to steal the ring from him and he now can't trust anyone (hence why nobody liked him). Sam almost drowns himself trying to catch up with Frodo's boat,
                                    so Frodo takes him along out of pity. The others of the party go off to look for two hobbits who were mistaken for Frodo and captured by Sarumon's orks.

                            <h2>The Two Towers</h2>
                                <p class="story">Part 2 starts out with the other guys going after the two throw away hobbits. They catch up with the orks who captured them, or at least their charred remains
                                    and assume the hobbits died until one of them turns it into CSI Miami and traces their DNA to the forest. They find the boys with Gandalf, whom after giving the Balrog the hands
                                    is reborn into a desperately needed more powerful Gandalf whom the crew mistakes for Sarumon, and he leaves the hobbits with 
                                    a giant talking tree (yes I'm serious), and leads the others to Rohan where they find their king until Sarumon's control. Gandalf saves him and they learn of Sarumon's plan to 
                                    attack and destroy Rohan. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam
                                    catch Smeagol stalking them and capture him since he can lead them to Mordor as they're somehow lost trying to find their way to the land of constantly ominous weather. They get 
                                    pretty close to Mordor's secret entrance but are captured
                                    by soldiers of Gondor, who believe them to be spies and detain them for questioning. Gondor is attacked by Sauron's army, forcing them to go help and bring Frodo and 
                                    friends along. After they save the city the Gondor commander (who is the brother of the guy who got killed in the 1st movie) decides to release Frodo to finish his quest.
                                    Back in Rohan, the King decides to evacuate the kingdom to a fortress called Helm's Deep to defend against Sarumon's invading forces. They are vastly outnumbered in the battle, but 
                                    some Elves arrive to help fight. While Sarumon's forces are away, the two useless hobbits do something decent and convince the talking trees to mess up Isengard, Sarumon's fort,
                                    after showing them all the trees Sarumon has harvested to fuel his war games. The seige on the fortress is long and brutal through the night. Most of the men and Elves are killed and 
                                    they are on the brink of being completely overrun until Gandalf appears with aid at the brink of dawn and drives the remaining orks away.

                            <h2>The Return of the King</h2>
                                <p class="story">The finale begins with Gandalf and the Rohan crew marching back to Isengard to gloat to Sarumon about their victory. During their trash talk and interrogation about Sauron's plans
                                    Sarumon dies but leaves behind a medieval pager of sorts to Sauron, so the crew gets them digits. One of the dopey hobbits tries chatting up Sauron and almost dies, but accidentally learns
                                    of his plans to attack the Gondor city of Minas Tirith. This gives Gandalf time to ride to the city with the moron hobbit and the others time to rally troops for the battle. Meanwhile, Frodo 
                                    and friends find the secret entrance to Mordor, a giant staircase on the mountain side leading to an ominous cave. Turns out Smeagol tricked them and was trying to get them killed by the giant spider
                                    'Shelob' who lives inside so he could steal the ring. The spider stabs Frodo and ingects him with paralyzing venom, so Sam takes the ring. Soon after, Sauron's orks find Frodo and take him hostage so Sam 
                                    has to go rescue him. He fights his way to Frodo who finally has awoke from Shelob's venom, and Sam gives the ring back hesitantly, resisting its allure. The two (having rid themselves of Smeagol) begin
                                    their trek across Mordor to Mount Doom to finally destroy the ring. Back in Rohan, the group is gathering troops for the battle but do not have enough to take on Sauron's forces at Minas Tirith. The 
                                    heir to Gondor's throne who's been with them since the first movie, hesitantly decides he has to summon the army of the dead to help even though they are traitors of his kingdom. He manages to gain 
                                    their support after showing he da boss and begins his road towards Minas Tirith to help. At the city under attack, it's not looking so hot. They are vastly outnumbered, have support from giant attacking elephats,
                                    and their leader is a coward nutjob. While the city is wasting away, Rohan finally arrives to support and does... something. Then a bit later the true king arrives with the dead army and takes care of the rest.
                                    The city, still mourning its losses, decides that to give Frodo the time and distraction from Sauron and his forces he needs to make it to Mount Doom and destroy the ring of power, they must gather everything 
                                    they have left and march to Mordor's gate for battle. They understand it is suicide but the only option to have a chance of winning the war, while Sauron's forces reassemble in Mordor. They are successful and 
                                    Sauron sends his army to meet them while Frodo and Sam run to the mountain. Right at the foot of the entrance they are attacked by Smeagol one final time, where Frodo wrestles free and runs into the mountain.
                                    He is too tempted by the ring's power however and can't bring his stupid self to drop it in the fire, so he puts the ring on, turning himself invisible, while Sam and Smeagol try to track him down, still fighting 
                                    each other. Smeagol finds invisible Frodo and bites the finger he was wearing the ring on clean off. Frodo ain't too happy about this and wrestles Smeagol off the edge of the platform and into the fire of Mount Doom,
                                    holding the ring. Both Smeagol and the ring are destroyed, and Sam manages to get Frodo and his bloody stump finger out of Mount Doom before it erupts from, idk the power of destroying the ring? Sauron is destroyed,
                                    and his army dissapates as Mordor itself collapses before the men who marched on it. The war is over, Gandalf finds Frodo and Sam and rescues them with the Eagles (and no this isn't
                                    a plot hole), and they all live happily ever after.
